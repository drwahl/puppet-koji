#See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji/ServerHowTo for instructions on how these certs were created.


#But here's a short script snippet that will do it.  Fill the [USER LIST] with a
#space delimited list of the users/hosts you wish to create certs for.

caname=koji
for user in [USER LIST]; do
   openssl genrsa -out certs/${user}.key 2048
   openssl req -config ssl.cnf -new -nodes -out certs/${user}.csr -key certs/${user}.key
   openssl ca -config ssl.cnf -keyfile private/${caname}_ca_cert.key -cert ${caname}_ca_cert.crt \
   -out certs/${user}.crt -outdir certs -infiles certs/${user}.csr
   cat certs/${user}.crt certs/${user}.key > ${user}.pem
done
